# Bookstore_Final_Project
Adding the folder I used for learning Backend
For this project, I learnt how to build a backend application, using MongoDB as my database. I learnt about different things. 
A bodyParser is a middleware of NodeJS used to handle HTTP Post requests. It can parse string-based client request body into a JS object which we can use in our application.

req (request) is a built-in Nodejs method used for loading modules.

A middleware in NodeJS is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an Object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.

Separation of concerns or responsibilities is the reason we compartmentalise code.

A config.js file is used to store configuration variables and settings. Centralising configuration settings in a config.js file makes it easier to manage and update settings without having to modify them in multiple places in your code. (It maintains consistency across different environments).
